I will join UPenn as an PhD student at Computer and Information Science Department in Fall 2020, advised by [Prof. Boon Thau Loo](https://boonloo.cis.upenn.edu). Before that, I had undergraduate education with highest honors in Beijing Jiaotong University at EE department. My research interest lies in ML/DL augmented system design and covers the broad areas of networked systems including software defined networking and networking protocols.
