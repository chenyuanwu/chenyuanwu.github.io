I received my Ph.D. in computer science from University of Pennsylvania in December 2024, advised by [Prof. Boon Thau Loo](https://boonloo.cis.upenn.edu). I also work closely with [Prof. Dahlia Malkhi (Chainlink Labs & UCSB)](https://malkhi.com/about/), [Prof. Ryan Marcus (UPenn)](https://rmarcus.info/blog/) and [Prof. Mohammad Javad Amiri (Stony Brook University)](https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~amiri/). My research interest mainly lies in blockchains and AI-driven systems. I am especially interested in using machine learning to build the next generation of decentralized systems that are adaptive and smart. In pursuit of this goal, I have researched and published across the system stack, from adaptive transaction management to adaptive Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus and their underlying infrastructure.
