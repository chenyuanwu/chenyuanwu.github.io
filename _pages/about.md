I am a third year Ph.D. student studying computer science at University of Pennsylvania, advised by [Prof. Boon Thau Loo](https://boonloo.cis.upenn.edu). I also work closely with [Prof. Mohammad Javad Amiri](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~amiri/) and [Prof. Ryan Marcus](https://rmarcus.info/blog/). My current research focuses on blockchains and machine learning in data management systems.
