I am a final year computer science Ph.D. candidate at University of Pennsylvania, advised by [Prof. Boon Thau Loo](https://boonloo.cis.upenn.edu). I also work closely with [Prof. Dahlia Malkhi (Chainlink Labs & UCSB)](https://malkhi.com/about/), [Prof. Mohammad Javad Amiri (Stony Brook University)](https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~amiri/) and [Prof. Ryan Marcus (UPenn)](https://rmarcus.info/blog/). My research focuses on the intersection of AI and databases, represented by the next generation of AI-driven distributed ledgers that are adaptive and smart.
