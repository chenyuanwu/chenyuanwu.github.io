I am a second year Ph.D. student studying Computer Science at UPenn, advised by [Prof. Boon Thau Loo](https://boonloo.cis.upenn.edu). Before that, I completed my B.E. in Electrical Engineering with highest honors at Beijing Jiaotong University. Currently, my research focuses on blockchains, resource disaggregation, and machine learning in computer systems.
